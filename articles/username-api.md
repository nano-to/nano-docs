# Nano.to Usernames

Nano.to Usernames are like aliases (or @handles) for your Nano address.

## Register a Username

To lease a Username, visit https://nano.to and search for your desired Username. If it says 'Available' it can be purchased, otherwise it is taken. 

> **Paying for your Username directly from an Exchange is NOT recommended. Exchanges usually subtract a fee and don't send the exact amount. Causing Nano.to, to not process your order correctly.** We recommend you pay using a third-party Wallet such as [Natrium](https://natrium.io/).

- Usernames may only contain letters and numbers, up to 30 characters long.
- You can lease multiple Usernames with the same nano address. 
- Any service that connects to Nano.to, will support Usernames. 
- Usernames are currently centralized, with plans for decentralization in the near future. 
- Every lease receives a percentage of daily Nano.to proceeds automatically, [every 24 hours](/faucet-api). 

> Nautilus Wallet users can purchase Nano.to Usernames right in-app. Available on [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nautilus-nano-wallet/id1615775960).

## Lease Renewals

You need to be mindful of when your Username rental expires. Nano.to has no way of contacting you, and we want to keep it that way. **It's a good idea to set a calendar date.**

Nano.to Username lease information is public. You can check the lease of any username, including your own by visting this URL in the browser or via code.

```
https://nano.to/:USERNAME/username
```

## Renewal grace period

To help prevent theft, every Username has a grace period for renewals after expiration, where only the original address may renew it.

- < 10 year - 14 Day Grace Period
- 10 year - 1 Month Grace Period

## Nano.to Connected Apps

We actively encourage other developers to add [Nano.to Usernames](/username-advanced-api) to their apps. This makes your Nano address "findable by Username" on a growing list of applications & games. Imagine playing a video game from Steam, and finding your Nano Username and Address on it, because the game supports Nano. Pretty rad!

> If privacy is your thing, don't get a Username for a particular address, and avoid the publicity.
