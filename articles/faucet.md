## How To Use

 Lease a Username by visting: https://nano.to  and search for your desired Username, and lease it. That's it. You don't have to anything else. Every 24 hours, you will automatically get (0.001 - 0.1) Nano deposited to your registered address. Actual payment amount may vary, but usually stays in this range, on average.

## Guidelines

These limitations are mostly in place to avoid sending funds to big Exchange addresses. 

- You can purchase multiple Usernames with the same NANO address.
- You will be paid for every Username, up to first 5 Usernames. 
- Address can't have more than 10,000 NANO balance (XNO, not USD).
- Address can't have more than 10,000 blocks (send and received payments).
- Address can't have more than 10 pending blocks from the Faucet address at the time of payment.
- The duration of the Lease does **not** affect the amount received. This might change in the future. 

## Funding 

Every 24 hours, 20% of Nano.to Development proceeds go to the Nano.to Faucet. 

- Faucet runs at 8PM (US-EAST), everyday.
- At the time of this writting,  ~500 usernames get a share of the Faucet balance. 

```
FAUCET BALANCE / USERNAMES = PAYMENT
```
