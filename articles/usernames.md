Nano.to Usernames are aliases for Nano addresses. They are standardized for API use, and cost a small nano fee. Usernames can be registered for 1 Month, 1 Year, 2 Years, 5 Years and 10 Years. To prevent bloat, usernames expire, and must be renewed.

## Register a Username

To lease a Username, visit https://nano.to and search for your desired Username.

- Usernames may only contain letters and numbers, up to 30 characters long.
- You can lease multiple Usernames with the same nano address. 
- Any service that connects to Nano.to, supports Usernames. 

## Renew a Username

You can renew your Username at any time by visting the following URL:

> Only the username owner can extend registration

```
https://nano.to/:USERNAME/renew
```

Demo: https://nano.to/Esteban/renew


## Nano.to Connected Apps

We actively encourage other developers to add [add Nano Usernames to their apps](/username-advanced-api.html).

> For privacy, don't get a Username for a particular address, and avoid the publicity.

## Dedicated Support

Software bugs happen. Be sure to mention the address you tried to pay with, and which Username you were trying to get.
