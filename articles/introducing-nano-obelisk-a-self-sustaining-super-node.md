A proper article is coming. For now here are some basics:

- Giant metal tower with the Nano logo on top
- Visible from quite far. 
- A monument, if you will.
- Starlink antenna (+ Fiber where possible)
- Solar Array for Power
- Geothermal Cooling
- Representative Nano Node
- Will be accessible via RPC.Nano.To
- I will live on-site for first few weeks while building it
- I will live-stream + record most of it.
- It will be built with reproducible parts.
- How to build it will be Open Source
- Donors can be Co-Owners and share profits.
