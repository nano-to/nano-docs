## About Nano.to

Nano is an open-source, decentralized digital currency. Released in 2015. You can learn more about the underlying technology at [nano.org](https://nano.org)

Nano.to (and the alias xno.to) is an API released in 2021, built on top of the Nano blockchain. We're an independent team of developers out of Miami, Florida. Making Usernames decentralized is a big goal of ours. Nano.to is in the process of putting everything on Github under an MIT license. Nano.to & Xno.to will continue to operate as the first domains. Look forward to that.

***Nano.to*** is the work of [@Nano2Dev](https://twitter.com/nano2dev) and funded by [Fresh Web Designs, LLC](https://fwd.dev). We also provide Nano.to customer support via email and twitter.
